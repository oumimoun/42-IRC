[X] +k: Set/remove the channel key (password).
[X] +l: Set/remove the user limit to channel.

The commands which may only be used by channel operators are:
    [X] KICK    - Eject a client from the channel

    [X] INVITE  - Invite a client to an invite-only channel (mode +i)
    [X] TOPIC   - Change the channel topic in a mode +t channel

A channel operator is identified by the '@' symbol next to their nickname

[ ] The prefix, command, and all parameters are separated by one (or more) ASCII space character(s) (0x20)
